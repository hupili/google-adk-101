In the 3rd century BC, it was established as a physical fact.\\n\\nHere's why we know the Earth is not square:\\n\\n*   **Ships disappearing hull first:** When a ship sails away from you, it doesn't just get smaller and smaller until it disappears. Instead, the hull of the ship disappears first, followed by the mast. This is because the Earth is curved, and the hull goes below the horizon before the mast does.\\n*   **Lunar eclipses:** During a lunar eclipse, the Earth passes between the Sun and the Moon, casting a shadow on the Moon. This shadow is always round, which wouldn't be the case if the Earth were flat or square.\\n*   **Different constellations:** Different constellations are visible from different parts of the Earth. For example, Polaris (the North Star) is higher in the sky in the Northern Hemisphere than it is in the Southern Hemisphere. This wouldn't be possible if the Earth were flat.\\n*   **Photographs from space:** We have countless photographs of Earth taken from space, and they all show a sphere.\\n*   **Gravity:** Gravity pulls everything towards the center of mass. If the Earth were flat, gravity would pull everything towards the center of the flat plane, which would make it very difficult to move around.\\n\\nWhile the Earth is often described as a sphere, it's more accurately described as an oblate spheroid. This means that it's slightly flattened at the poles and bulges at the equator due to the centrifugal force created by the Earth's rotation.\\n\"}], 'role': 'model'}, 'grounding_metadata':

Instead, the hull of the ship disappears first, followed by the mast. This is because the Earth is curved, and the hull goes below the horizon before the mast does.\\n*   **Lunar eclipses:** During a lunar eclipse, the Earth passes between the Sun and the Moon, casting a shadow on the Moon. This shadow is always round, which wouldn't be the case if the Earth were flat or square.\\n*   **Different constellations:** Different constellations are visible from different parts of the Earth. For example, Polaris (the North Star) is higher in the sky in the Northern Hemisphere than it is in the Southern Hemisphere. This wouldn't be possible if the Earth were flat.\\n*   **Photographs from space:** We have countless photographs of Earth taken from space, and they all show a sphere.\\n*   **Gravity:** Gravity pulls everything towards the center of mass. If the Earth were flat, gravity would pull everything towards the center of the flat plane, which would make it very difficult to move around.\\n\\nWhile the Earth is often described as a sphere, it's more accurately described as an oblate spheroid.
